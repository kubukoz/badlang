# Let's build an IDE!
## Jakub Koz≈Çowski | Scala in the city | 26 X 2023

---

## Why build an IDE?

1. For fun
1. For your proprietary DSL
1. **So that you have a talk topic**

---

## No, for real, why?

- You want editor support for your language
- You're not happy with existing editors

---

## Step 1

How much do you want to do from scratch?

### UI

- Write your own frontend?
- [Monaco?](https://github.com/microsoft/monaco-editor/)
- Existing editor?

### Analysis

- Just syntax <!-- can be done in any environment -->
- "Best effort" semantic analysis <!-- can be done in any environment -->
- Using compiler tools <!-- may require special setup e.g. a JVM -->

## With LSP

```
~~~graph-easy --as=boxart
[ VS Code ] { origin: LSP; offset: -2, 0; } -> {start: east; end: west;} [LSP]
[ Your IDE ] { origin: VS Code; offset: 0, 2; } -> {start: east; end: west;} [LSP]
[ Neovim ] { origin: Your IDE; offset: 0, 2; } -> {start: east; end: west;} [LSP]
[ LSP ] -> [ Scala ] { origin: LSP; offset: 2, 0; }
[ LSP ] -> [ Rust ] { origin: Scala; offset: 0, 2; }
[ LSP ] -> [ Java ] { origin: Rust; offset: 0, 2; }
